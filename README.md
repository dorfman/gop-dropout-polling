# gop-dropout-polling
Show how polling changes when a Republican candidate suspends their campaign for the presidential nomination. Only examined candidates that dropped out during primary season.

This was my final project for a Data Science class. Data set last updated on April 1, 2016.

## Viewing
On mobile, GitHub displays the raw json that Python notebooks are written on. Need to view in desktop mode for GitHub to run a .ipynb file. For concise display of final results, go to [Display.ipynb](https://github.com/dorfman/gop-dropout-polling/blob/master/Display.ipynb)

## Running
Run .ipynb files on [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/).
